# FTL_Autopatcher
Scripts that speed up addon patching processes.

___

- These are some quick scripts that I made a while ago,
- These can zip up addon folders and patch them in one click, which enables faster addon development

**NOTE** Place these inside your slipstream folder (or wherever "modman.exe" is) in order to for them to work

the first simple script zips up the dev folder and patches it
the second script allows for more complex patching options (set up directions are inside) 
the last one makes a copy of your save file folder (useful for extreme testing cases, or save scumming.)
